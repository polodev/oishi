          I like you so much.
          You are amazing. You are beautiful.
          <br>
          With the level of the caliber you have, I will always be happy if I get company from you. 
          Despite having a lot of incidents in mind I am writing this to you because I want to listen to my heart.  I feel always great when I think about you. I love you so much. I believe No one can be as in love with you as I am. What should I go to do about it? I want to listen from you. 
          <br>
          Is it too early a proposition? 
          <br>
          Feeling uncomfortable? Please keep it one-sided love . Just keep connected like previously. It is making me happy
          <br>
          Regards
          -----------
