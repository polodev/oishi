       Hello Oishi,  <br>
      I like you so much.
      <br>
          You are amazing. You are beautiful. With the level of caliber you have, I always will be happy if I get your company.
          Despite having a lot of incidents in mind, I am writing this to you because, I want to listen to my heart. 
          I always feel great when I think about you. 
          I love you so much. I believe No one can be, as in love with you as I am. 
          What should I go to do about it? I want to listen from you. 
          <br>
          Is it too early a proposition? 
          <br>
          Feeling uncomfortable? Please keep it, one-sided love. Just keep connected like previously. It is making me happy
          <br>
          Regards
          <br>
          -----------
